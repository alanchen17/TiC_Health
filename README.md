# TiC_Health
First, let me just say it is very interesting to see what other people have come up with. Ironically, but simply search up Serif Health - you can see others' approach. Kudos to the creative repo names ðŸ˜Œ. (https://github.com/search?q=serif%20health&type=repositories). However, this is in fact my work and no ideas/code were copied or taken from others.

## The script or code used to parse the file and produce output.

## The setup or packaging file(s) required to bootstrap and execute your solution code

## The output URL list.


## A README file, explaining your solution, how long it took you to write, how long it took to run, and the tradeoffs you made along the way.
